Slides from a presentation I gave on August 4, 2025 to report on my work as a Data Engineer Intern at [3DEO](https://3deolidar.com/), a spin-out from MIT Lincoln Laboratory specializing in Geiger-mode lidar for the commercial market.

Note that some links in the presentation are relative paths to files in `aux` and `references`, which will not work if opening the presentation without downloading this directory.
